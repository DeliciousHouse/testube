## About
<p>This is a web application that allows Tesla drivers to have easy access to a multitude of media services while their vehicle is in park. What makes this special is that it triggers "Theater Mode", which will make the application and anything clicked within it be open on the entire screen.</p>

## Compatibility
<p>During development, this application was tested on the lead developer's Tesla Model 3. He does not have access to any other Tesla model. That being said, this should also work on any Model S or X that has MCU 2, 2.5, or the FSD Computer. If you believe that it should be working on your car, but it isn't, please report it in the issue tracker with any relevent information.</p>

## Contribute
<p>Pull requests are welcome. The application is written in Typescript using the latest Angular framework.</p>
<p>To get started, fork the project and then run `npm start` from the root of the project to spin up a development version.</p>
